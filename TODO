# TODO

## Autocomplete

Use gtk.EntryCompletion to provide automatic completion of known commands.

## History

Record commands entered by the user. Offer them as suggestions in autocomplete.

## "Smart Tab"

Hit <Tab> to skip over arguments in the history.

More details to come.

## UI for managing configuration

This should largely deprecate .medrc.

## "Default handler"

Attempts to make a smart guess at what the user meant for an unknown input.

e.g. entering a URL should open the browser.

Another idea here might be wildcards e.g.

"treat all commands starting with 'http://*' as a URL"
"treat all commands starting with '/*' as a file system path"

## PyPI package.

Publish this app to PyPI.

## Packages for Debian/Ubuntu/Mint and RedHat/Fedora.
