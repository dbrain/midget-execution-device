# TODO

## Clean up (ongoing)

Everything's a little bit of a mess right now. Clean up.

## History

Record commands entered by the user. Offer them as suggestions in autocomplete.

## "Smart Tab"

Hit <Tab> to skip over arguments from the last entered command and/or a
history item. Trailing arguments should be highlighted for replacement in
the editor.

## UI for managing configuration

This should largely deprecate .medrc.

Should include UI to integrate with GNOME startup etc.

## "Default handler"

Attempts to make a smart guess at what the user meant for an unknown input.

e.g. entering a URL should open the browser.

Another idea here might be wildcards e.g.

"treat all commands starting with 'http://*' as a URL"
"treat all commands starting with '/*' as a file system path"

**XXX** As of 2011-12-07 this functionality is present, but hard-coded.

Advanced users should be able to define their own custom commands.

## More intuitive custom commands

${...} substitution can get a bit unwieldy for all but the simplest inputs
(maybe a good thing?).

Think about some alternatives.

## Automatically install default keyboard shortcuts

Everything I've read about this sounds like pain. There has to be a better way.

## PyPI package.

Publish this app to PyPI.

## Packages for Debian/Ubuntu/Mint and RedHat/Fedora.

Packages & distribution for .deb and .rpm.

## A better name for the project

Honestly, what were you smoking?

## A real logo

Currently using STOCK_OPEN. :S
